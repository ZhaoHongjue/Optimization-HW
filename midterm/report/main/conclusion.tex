\section{Conclusion}
In this work, I introduce the rigde regression and implement Gradient Method, Conjugate Gradient Methods and
quasi-Newton methods. Then I test them on three different datasets and show related results. I also have a better
understanding through exactly coding. I really hope I can use them in my future work.
