\section{Requirements}

Based on small datasets \emph{abalone}, \emph{bodyfat} and \emph{housing},
training a \emph{ridge regression} model with algorithms Gradient Descent, 
Conjugate Descent, and quasi-Newton method respectively.

Requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement algorithms (Gradient Descent, Conjugate Descent, and 
        quasi-Newton method) using C/C++ programming language.
    \item In this answer sheet, please briefly introduce
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The ridge regression;
            \item The training algorithms that you implement;
            \item Experimental settings;
            \item Experimental results.
        \end{enumerate}
        Please illustrate with diagrams, the Mean Squared Error of different 
        algorithms at each iteration, and analyze the results in light of what
        you have learned in this course.
    \item Compress the pdf file of this answer sheet and the C/C++ program into 
        a zip file, and submit it.
\end{enumerate}
